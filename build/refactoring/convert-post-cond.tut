 vim: se filetype=ruby:

1. Convert this conditional by typing `:RConvertPostConditional`

my_func(2) if other_func == true

2. Type `<leader>rcpc` for the same effect.
NOTE: <leader> is mapped to \ by default, so in practice this means you type \rcpc.

my_other_func(3) if other_func == true

NOTE: The modeline at the top of the file tells vim to treat this file as a ruby file. You can find out more by typing `:h modeline`.
